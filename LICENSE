If SOFTWARE is software which has been developed and/or enhanced by or for a SIEMENS GAS AND POWER OPERATING COMPANY and for which the SIEMENS GAS AND POWER OPERATING COMPANY had granted to INNER SOURCE CONTRIBUTOR corresponding sublicensing rights, the license of this Section 2  shall be limited to the SIEMENS CURRENT FIELD.

For avoidance of doubt, a PARTICIPATING SIEMENS ENTITY shall not be entitled to grant third parties exclusive rights to the SOFTWARE and to make available to third parties its PRODUCTS containing SOFTWARE and/or modified versions thereof under license terms that violate or conflict with the terms of this license or any applicable agreement referring to this license. 
Furthermore all PARTICIPATING SIEMENS ENTITIES shall
    i. comply with all current restrictions, obligations and guidelines posted on or referenced by the SIEMENS CODE REPOSITORY and additional restrictions and/or obligations – if any available – in an optional file named “RESTRICTIONS.md file” associated with the respective SOFTWARE on the SIEMENS CODE REPOSITORY; and

Revised and/or new versions of this license released on the SIEMENS CODE REPOSITORY become binding at the given change effective date.
The SIEMENS CODE REPOSITORY shall show which version of the license applies to which SOFTWARE.

6. Termination
